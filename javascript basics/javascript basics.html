         <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
         <br>
         <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, onject-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety ov reasons.
             It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for develoopers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
            Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node sserver), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

            <p><li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values-imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                a variable holds a value. All Javascript varianles must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identities. var x;
            </li></p>
            <p><li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;</li></p>
            <p><li><a href="">Data Types</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean-true or false; null-null aka nothing;Number-42 or 3.14159
            ;String-"Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array-[1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'] and Object- (first_name. 'Jane, last,_name: 'Doe')</li></p>
            <p><li><a href="">Loops</a> There are many differnet kinds of loops of in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run anround the track four tumes and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li></p>
            <p><li><a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our functions this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting togethre a desk from Ikea, we open up the instructions manual and get started,
            first we screw the legs to the table too; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and voer again.</li></p>
